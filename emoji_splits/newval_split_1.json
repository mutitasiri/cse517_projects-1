These simple, hand-thrown weapons had been invented hundreds of years before, but had not been widely used since the Napoleonic era. Reinvented by the requirements of trench warfare, the first grenades in 1914 were often hand-made, consisting of old cans filled with nails and bits of metal and packed with gunpowder. They often proved as dangerous to their makers as to their intended targets, due to the risk of premature explosion.\n\nBy the end of 1915, all armies were being supplied with hand bombs. Rifle grenadiers fired specifically modified grenades from rifles, while the infantry on both sides carried dozens of different types. The Germans tended to prefer the stick bomb, which could be thrown farther but had a smaller explosive charge. The British and Canadians used egg-shaped hand grenades, which could be thrown about 30 metres (10 metres\u00a0fewer than the German sticks), but carried a larger explosive charge.\n\nBy 1917, all infantry carried grenades. All major assaults required attacking troops to carry extra grenades to capture their objectives and then hold them against enemy counterattack.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComrades:\n@jon.the.collector\n@united_warfronts\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria #unitedwarfronts", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f0d2f90c192fb2d88f858a9257bc9b7e/5BF2BED1/t51.2885-15/e35/36930914_666797756999951_56316684926976000_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxMzE5NTY5OTMyNDEyMg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 655}, {"id": "37138792_661000007606843_3224137116229304320_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "totnes graffiti", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["brexit", "graffiti", "Totnes"], "orig_caption": "Totnes graffiti #Totnes #graffiti #brexit", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/01367b77c7c075f1e6f4eb36b30d4a83/5BE5FF37/t51.2885-15/e35/37138792_661000007606843_3224137116229304320_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTM2Nzg2NjIwMjY2MTQ2MQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 4}, {"id": "37077711_423456244814680_4189896727899144192_n", "semiotic": "divergent", "intent": "expose", "caption": "even though of this town voted leave its still a pretty decent place to live", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["Summer", "Brexit", "HerneBay", "Vibesandthat"], "orig_caption": "Even though 90% of this town voted leave it's still a pretty decent place to live #Brexit #HerneBay #Summer #Vibesandthat", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c31c51ef1cde98645abf7e0c97c4fdcc/5BF20205/t51.2885-15/e35/37077711_423456244814680_4189896727899144192_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxNTkxMzc5OTgxODQ1MA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 7}, {"id": "36885182_251213522349791_5158221611865735168_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["fridaythe13th"], "orig_caption": "#fridaythe13th", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e790a3e379428ca33b8aa8181e5368e7/5C11C988/t51.2885-15/e35/36885182_251213522349791_5158221611865735168_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyMzAxMjg4OTQwNjEyNTMyNw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 5281}, {"id": "35355096_2095282807426602_2488737624508858368_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "inform", "caption": "a british soldier visits a comrades grave at sunset on the cliffs above cape helles gallipoli in be sure to follow us for more facts about wwi", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["Canada", "Turkey", "Italy", "worldwar1", "Scotland", "greatwar", "royalairforce", "battle", "soldiers", "raf", "death", "USA", "Austria", "trenches", "followme", "war", "ww1", "Roosevelt", "germany", "France", "Russia", "worldwar", "Churchill", "tank", "historiansunion", "guns", "Britain", "planes", "history"], "orig_caption": "A British soldier visits a comrade's grave at sunset on the cliffs above Cape Helles, Gallipoli in 1915.\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #raf #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/28fd5a0cb5a360a8dc46af8a92f60a6f/5BD821CB/t51.2885-15/e35/35355096_2095282807426602_2488737624508858368_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgxMDYyMTkzNzQ5NjYwMDMzNw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 390}, {"id": "36149391_232084944076103_5668288161252376576_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "when filled with you make better choices \ud83c\udf3c \u2728 for", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["Love", "PraiseGod", "Unconditional", "HappySunday", "selflove"], "orig_caption": "When you\u2019re filled with #selflove \u2014you make better choices\ud83c\udf3c\u2728 #HappySunday #PraiseGod for #Unconditional #Love", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9a95864b9c3177872c042bfb8765d5b8/5BD1DD4D/t51.2885-15/e35/36149391_232084944076103_5668288161252376576_n.jpg?efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJ1cmxnZW5fZnJvbV9pZyJ9&se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgxOTA5NDg3MTI4NDAxNTY5NQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 44}, {"id": "37232632_291584754743370_3367074426704101376_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 free giveaway \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 giving away free flags for the next hours click the link in my bio to claim yours \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 comment what you won", "contextual": "close", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8FREE GIVEAWAY\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\u2022\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 We\u2019re giving away FREE FLAGS for the next 24 hours!

Four years later Sir John married Robert's daughter, Princess Joanna. It was their son, Sir John Lyon of Glamis, who began work on turning the old royal hunting lodge he had inherited into the Glamis Castle you see today.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe Lyons of Glamis nearly came unstuck over an argument in the early 1500s. As a child, James V was dominated, and later kidnapped, by his stepfather, Archibald Douglas. When James V gained power in 1528 he took his revenge on the whole of his stepfather's family.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nArchibald Douglas's sister, Janet Douglas, was the widow of John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis. James V brought charges of witchcraft against her, had her imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle and then, in 1537 had her burned at the stake. Janet\u2019s infant son was also condemned to death. Relations with the crown were later restored when Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Glamis Castle in 1562.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nJohn, the 5th Earl, supported the 1715 Jacobite uprising and was killed at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. A month later and before fleeing the country as the uprising collapsed, James VIII/III, stayed at Glamis Castle with 88 of his supporters. While there he is said to have healed a number of locals by touching them, a sign to the Jacobites that he was indeed the rightful king.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1767 John, the 9th Earl of Strathmore, married Mary Eleanor Bowes, heiress to the vast estates of her father, George Bowes. John and Mary's son, the 10th Earl, took the family name of Bowes Lyon and established a new family crest.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nMore recently, Glamis castle served as the childhood home of Elizabeth Bowes Lyon (Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother) and was birthplace of her daughter, Princess Margaret.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @maltese_rose_photography

He has done a terrible job. \nTake a look at the terrorism that he is taking place. Look at what is going on in London.\" Sadiq Khan is coming under increasing pressure from the backlash of the public to make London safe. In an interview, Khan stated that he would authorise the baby Sadiq Khan balloon so long as it was \"peaceful and safe\" just like baby Trump balloon. \nThe man behind the project, Yanny Bruere, states; \"I think it's insulting and childish. We shouldn't be making the US President feel unwelcome. Trump has made America safe and has made the world safe. In London, under Sadiq Khan as mayor, crime is soaring to unprecedented levels and people don\u2019t feel safe.\" [Access the crowdfunding page by clicking the link in Bio.] #feminism #feminist

The Pohangina River was a location I had in mind for a while to re-shoot, but struggled with the cloud cover in this area of the country.
