He most likely built the first castle on this site.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe Fifes of Strathbogie lost their lands and titles in 1314, after siding with the English at the Battle of Bannockburn. The victorious Robert the Bruce granted Strathbogie to a loyal supporter, Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nAround 1445, Alexander, 2nd Lord Gordon, was created Earl of Huntly and became the King's chief lieutenant in North East Scotland, responsible for fighting the Black Douglases.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nHowever, by the mid-16th century the wealth of the Earl of Huntly was starting to be seen as a threat. After the 4th Earl continued to hear the mass despite its ban by the Reformation Act (1560), a Royal army was sent north to deal with the earl. He died in an accident on his way to Edinburgh to answer for his actions but, not to be denied a court hearing, the Government put his embalmed corpse on trial for treason.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDespite the fate of the 4th Earl, the Gordons remained in control of the castle and also continued their support for the Catholic cause. George Gordon, Fifth Earl of Huntly supported the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots in the civil war of 1568. However, following the Earl\u2019s role in the Spanish Blanks plot, James VI took action, forcing the Earl to flee to France. The King and Earl were later reconciled in 1597, with George Gordon being created Marquis of Huntly.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was sufficiently intact to be used as a garrison for Government troops following the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion but thereafter it drifted into ruin. It was placed into State care in 1923.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @pinkrachelc\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #gameofthrones #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #scotland_insta #thisisscotland #travelphotography #abandonedplaces #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #palace #modernoutdoors #conservation #greatnorthcollective #castleruins", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/683bf1258e0871563eef9e61817481ab/5BE38E6B/t51.2885-15/e35/36620103_2103858056536004_8261522069489975296_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyNDkyNDA2MDg0MTM5NjkyNg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 3674}, {"id": "37140492_2146110182293132_5643068916449148928_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "advocate", "caption": "we must kep our eye on jesus stay connected with god jususlovesus", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["faithfulgod", "blessedmom", "grateful", "church", "verseoftheday", "praying", "jesusfirst", "trustgod", "jesusislove", "god", "holybible", "christianwoman", "scripture", "thebible", "godblessamerica", "jesuscristo", "jesussaves", "risen", "dailybibleverse", "jesuscalling", "biblejournalingcommunity", "christians", "jesusisking", "glorytogod", "godsgift", "godisfaithful", "jesustakethewheel", "god1st", "vatican", "jesuslovesyou"], "orig_caption": "We must kep our eye on Jesus\nStay connected with God @jusus_loves_us\n#god #grateful #church #faithfulgod #godisfaithful #glorytogod #jesuscalling #holybible #jesusislove #verseoftheday #godsgift #christians #jesuscristo #jesuslovesyou #jesusisking #blessedmom #vatican #christianwoman #jesustakethewheel #praying #scripture #thebible #god1st #godblessamerica #risen #trustgod #jesusfirst #jesussaves #dailybibleverse #biblejournalingcommunity", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/4d3d4a7afc4d127a1682d648393072aa/5BDFA9D4/t51.2885-15/e35/37140492_2146110182293132_5643068916449148928_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTAzNzEzMTgzNDk3NTMwNQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 524}, {"id": "37174493_434868490327287_6215269744094740480_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "red cannas \ud83d\udcf7 canon ae lab dunwoodyphoto", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["fujifeed", "ishootfilm", "shootfilmnotmegapixels", "filmphotography", "shootfilm", "canon", "girlsonfilm", "filmisnotdead", "canonae1", "analog", "canon_photos", "analogfeatures", "fujifilm", "tangledinfilm", "minimalismo", "film", "abmathome", "35mmfilm", "photography", "believeinfilm", "atlantaphotographer", "canonphotography", "35mm", "staybrokeshootfilm", "minimalism", "nofilter", "jesscrete"], "orig_caption": "Red Cannas. \ud83d\udcf7: canon ae-1\nlab: @dunwoodyphoto\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#35mm #35mmfilm #film #fujifeed #fujifilm #shootfilm #ishootfilm #canonae1 #canon #canonphotography #canon_photos #staybrokeshootfilm #shootfilmnotmegapixels #filmisnotdead #filmphotography #photography #analog #analogfeatures #nofilter #believeinfilm #tangledinfilm #atlantaphotographer #minimalism #minimalismo #girlsonfilm #abmathome\n#jesscrete", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/035901916831bd0fc5e383aa6964dfca/5C0EC81D/t51.2885-15/e35/37174493_434868490327287_6215269744094740480_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTQxNDgwNTM5MDA1NDI3NQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 7}, {"id": "37302766_1513451168759260_2001488033047642112_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "express", "caption": "i hate it without you \ud83d\ude2b \ud83d\ude16", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["neverforgetyou", "staysafe", "missyou", "staystrong", "rip", "youlightupmyworld", "careforyou", "loveyou"], "orig_caption": "I hate it without you\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude16#rip #neverforgetyou #staystrong #youlightupmyworld #missyou #loveyou #careforyou #staysafe", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/afba6439d4eb1251cff713be2026b349/5BEF5F5C/t51.2885-15/e35/37302766_1513451168759260_2001488033047642112_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTM1OTI0MjI4NzQ5MjkwNQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 1}, {"id": "36918973_508515022939299_1527112442847428608_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "great gatsby bat mitzvah for very special one classic gold and black themed party with a mix of our washington dining chair and deco dining chair planner alianaevents rentalsdesign revelryeventdesign florist celiosdesign photo dinadouglass table top rentals fancytables venue themajesticdowntown", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "Great Gatsby bat mitzvah for very special one!

She has written plays about identity politics and identity crises in the lives of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, feminists and evangelicals. In \u201cStraight White Men,\u201d she scrutinizes what she calls the new ethnic group on the scene: straight white men. For so long simply the default humans, they now face all the indignities of life with a label. Her work is about wrongness: about being the wrong kind of man, woman, Asian; about saying the wrong thing; about getting other people wrong. What makes the new play so weird isn\u2019t what she adds but what she takes out. The main character barely speaks. She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations. \u201cIdentity politics saved my life,\u201d she said. It gave her the language to understand the racism she encountered as a child growing up in small-town Washington State.

That the drink is an attention-grabbing orange certainly helps. At Aperol-adjacent events, it\u2019s not unusual to see friends posing for photos, clinking their spritzes in the sun. And they might even be wearing #Aperol accessories. The strategy seems to be working. According to Nielsen, Aperol sales have gone up 48% since last summer. The spike is in line with a rising demand in the U.S. for herbal bitter liqueurs, or amaro, more generally. \u201cThe Aperol spritz is here to stay,\u201d Melanie Batchelor said. \u201cIt plays into trends \u2014 Americans are starting to appreciate more bitter tastes and they want more drinks that are low in alcohol content.\u201d @karstenmoran took this photo of an #AperolSpritz.

As the Earls of Cassilis, the family prospered, with one member marrying a daughter of King Robert III, while another went on to become Bishop of St Andrews.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure has been noted in history on a number of occasions. In 1429 a meeting took place here between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell, however, did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1563 Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Dunure Castle as the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis. Gilbert was, however, not always so hospitable towards his guests. In September 1570, Dunure Castle was the scene of a gruesome event during which Gilbert Kennedy roasted alive the Commendator of Crossraguel, in order to force him to transfer to him some of the lands belonging to the Abbey. The Commendator yielded after two turns of the spit and survived his injuries.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure Castle has been in private hands since 1704 and by the middle of the century had fallen into disrepair.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @sharonwilsonphotography \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland  #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #natureaddict #thisisscotland #lifeofadventure #master_shots #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #modernoutdoors #greatnorthcollective #travelblogger #abandonedplaces #ruins #abandoned_addiction #scotland_insta", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/2c690fd8eca120acac17ec70ce4e4134/5BD0D651/t51.2885-15/e35/37067564_427634414406393_5758280619595399168_n.jpg?se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgyNTY2MjM0MDkyMjY1OTI1OQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 3386}, {"id": "36783381_2264032236946535_9120344485912379392_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "provoke", "caption": "they better have a good look at themselves before criticizing others j tags ignore", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["canadafirst", "liberal", "conservativeparty", "politics", "rightwing", "canadastrong", "canada", "usa", "conservative", "libtards", "politicalcorrectness", "tories", "canadiansfirst", "notmyprimeminister", "parliamenthill", "republican", "cdnpoli", "wakeupcanada", "godblesscanada", "canadianpolitics", "democracy", "canadian", "cpc", "democrat", "ottawa", "capitalism", "socialism", "makecanadagreatagain", "uk", "truenorthstrongandfree"], "orig_caption": "They better have a good look at themselves before criticizing others. ~J\n---------------------------------------------------\nTags: (Ignore)\n#canadian #canadastrong #canadafirst #canadiansfirst #wakeupcanada #politicalcorrectness #uk #usa #canada #ottawa #parliamenthill #democracy #politics #canadianpolitics #cdnpoli #rightwing #conservative #liberal #republican #democrat #capitalism #socialism #cpc #conservativeparty #tories #truenorthstrongandfree #godblesscanada #makecanadagreatagain #notmyprimeminister #libtards\n---------------------------------------------------", "url": "https://scontent-ort2-2.cdninstagram.com/vp/208a18ad97dfbd4386f74fbeb8cce88e/5BD41DF6/t51.2885-15/e35/36783381_2264032236946535_9120344485912379392_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyNjQ1OTU5NTE0MjgwMzE3NQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 210}, {"id": "34815246_2106096592980271_8832579443697385472_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "portrait fminin critrium graphite", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["portrait", "sketch", "graphite", "drawing"], "orig_caption": "Portrait f\u00e9minin crit\u00e9rium graphite #drawing #sketch #graphite #portrait", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/e8f6e3ecc9ead94c872d236861d514b0/5BED4E99/t51.2885-15/e35/34815246_2106096592980271_8832579443697385472_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTc3MTY1MDM1NTEzNTIzOTA1OQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 278}, {"id": "36661211_1074256076082836_8165365529918308352_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "expose", "caption": "no", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["sully", "hubbyhasthemap", "mapandcompass", "weekendhunt", "daughter", "family", "daughtertime", "beautifulgirl", "bringiton", "wallaceandgromit", "familyfun", "itssofluffy", "gromitunleashed2", "itssofluffyimgonnadie", "thegrandappeal", "kidsofinstagram", "starter", "mummydaughtertime"], "orig_caption": "No.1!

One of the goals: to protect the waters that flow into Bristol Bay, home to the world\u2019s largest salmon fishery. It would take many lifetimes to hike all of Lake Clark\u2019s glaciers, mountains, volcanoes and tundra; paddle all of the park\u2019s lakes and shoreline; and spot the wide range of wildlife large (bears, lynx, eagles and wolves) and small (collared pika and tundra shrew) that call the area home.
