Over the years, and not infrequently, landslides have taken out portions of the highway. But none were as big as the one in May 2017, when some 6 million cubic yards of earth moved after torrential rainfalls, adding 15 acres of coastline. Before that, in 2016, a large wildfire near Big Sur burned more than 130,000 acres.

I don\u2019t know about you guys, but\u2014when I was in school\u2014I was most concerned with my classroom supplies, getting a new backpack, and what I was going to wear for the first week back to class. It\u2019s funny how we spend so much time prepping for our education, but very little time preparing our spirits for what it takes to be a Christian on and off campus. Any place you go becomes and mission field for God when you are an ambassador for Christ. That doesn\u2019t mean shouting scriptures at the top of your lungs when you walk down the hallway, but it does mean building up your faith and preparing yourself to be a witness in the midst of peer pressure, bullying, drama, and gossip. In my latest YouTube video, I talk about four ways to keep your walk with God strong on campus. Whether you\u2019re in middle school, high school, or college (or know someone who is), click on the link in my bio to watch. Share with anyone you think could benefit from this information it as well. Now it\u2019s your turn: what are some of the things that helped you keep your faith strong in school?

The World\u2019s Strongest Man competition was a pillar of the so-called \u201ctrash sports\u201d craze in the 1970s. Now, tech powerhouses like Amazon, Facebook and YouTube are experimenting with sports rights. \u201cIt is the greatest time to be a sports fan in the history of the world,\u201d said Burke Magnus, the @espn executive in charge of programming. No matter how small or unpopular a league or team is, their games are probably streaming to fans somewhere, he said. To be sure, streaming services and the niche sports they show face plenty of significant challenges before they become a viable alternative to broadcast or cable TV. But Steve is an optimist. Arm wrestling was ready for a reboot, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s ordinary people doing extraordinary things.\u201d @mattrothphoto took this photo of Matt Mask, left, competing against Marcio Barboza at the World Armwrestling League.

listening to a podcast this morning..\n.\nThe msg I\u2019m getting is \u2014> What are you sacrificing because you\u2019re too comfortable?\n.\nIf you\u2019re not willing to take a step back or sacrifice (discomfort), you\u2019re not finding your true potential\ud83d\udcab\n.\nWhat\u2019s a step back or discomfort \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n- Status\n- People\u2019s opinions of you\n- Others expectations\n- Being a beginner\n- Looking silly\n- Starting from the bottom\n- Earning less now for more later \nIt could go on right ?!\n.\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s different for all.\nI know for me personally, I was willing to leave a good paying job in order to build true wealth and follow that \u2018excitement\u2019.\n.\nI had r\u2019ships go balls up because what I was doing wasn\u2019t \u2018liked\u2019 or more so, understood at the time.\n.\nI\u2019ve gotten more \u2018No\u2019s\u2019 or rejection by the age of 30 than most people do in their LIFEtime and that has been a choice of discomfort I\u2019m SO okay with.\n.\nSaying \u2018YES\u2019 to things that make my stomach turn but trusting myself enough to know I\u2019ll be okay.\n.\nSo babes, always ask yourself\u2014> When was the last time you sacrificed \u2018comfort\u2019 (without whinging about it) to find true potential? .\nTrue potential is where we build + find our best selves. .\nAnd if you\u2019re not excited by the person you will get to be and meet in 5yrs, 10yrs ++, from the decisions + discomfort you\u2019re choosing now...(firstly, WTF! \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f do you know how incredible she will be?!)\n....maybe look at what you\u2019re sacrificing because you\u2019re too damn comfortable. .\nYou\u2019re always sacrificing something. You just get to choose what. .\nI know I have. \nAnd these next 6mths, I feel HUGE discomfort happening...therefore huge potential available.
