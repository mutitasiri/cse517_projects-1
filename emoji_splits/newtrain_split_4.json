The first pieces of the highway opened in the 1920s. Later, the route became entwined with the lore of California. Over the years, and not infrequently, landslides have taken out portions of the highway. But none were as big as the one in May 2017, when some 6 million cubic yards of earth moved after torrential rainfalls, adding 15 acres of coastline. Before that, in 2016, a large wildfire near Big Sur burned more than 130,000 acres.

Her work is about wrongness: about being the wrong kind of man, woman, Asian; about saying the wrong thing; about getting other people wrong. What makes the new play so weird isn\u2019t what she adds but what she takes out. The main character barely speaks. She said that the goal of the play was to spark conversations. \u201cIdentity politics saved my life,\u201d she said. It gave her the language to understand the racism she encountered as a child growing up in small-town Washington State. But its rhetoric has curdled, she feels. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re good or you\u2019re evil; you\u2019re a queer woman of color or you\u2019re some version of entitled privileged person,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like compassion is very out right now. Curiosity is out. What\u2019s in is condemnation and punishment. Now is not the moment for nuance; people do not want it.\u201d @paolakudacki took this photo of #YoungJeanLee for @nytmag.

Although a natural spring existed it was clearly insufficient.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nEver mindful of the fearful massacre at Dunaverty Castle in May 1647, the clansmen within the castle surrendered.

Gylen was sacked and burnt.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nGylen Castle has remained a ruin ever since the Covenanter attack. The ruins became famous after being painted by the artist J.W.M Turner in 1831.

That the drink is an attention-grabbing orange certainly helps. At Aperol-adjacent events, it\u2019s not unusual to see friends posing for photos, clinking their spritzes in the sun. And they might even be wearing #Aperol accessories. The strategy seems to be working. According to Nielsen, Aperol sales have gone up 48% since last summer. The spike is in line with a rising demand in the U.S. for herbal bitter liqueurs, or amaro, more generally. \u201cThe Aperol spritz is here to stay,\u201d Melanie Batchelor said. \u201cIt plays into trends \u2014 Americans are starting to appreciate more bitter tastes and they want more drinks that are low in alcohol content.\u201d @karstenmoran took this photo of an #AperolSpritz.

In 1429 a meeting took place here between James Campbell, representing King James I of Scotland and John Mor MacDonald, representing the Lord of the Isles. Violence broke out and MacDonald was killed. James I's efforts to contain the outrage of the Lords of the Isles by executing Campbell, however, did not prevent a subsequent uprising by them.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1563 Mary, Queen of Scots stayed at Dunure Castle as the guest of Gilbert Kennedy, the 4th Earl of Cassilis. Gilbert was, however, not always so hospitable towards his guests. In September 1570, Dunure Castle was the scene of a gruesome event during which Gilbert Kennedy roasted alive the Commendator of Crossraguel, in order to force him to transfer to him some of the lands belonging to the Abbey. The Commendator yielded after two turns of the spit and survived his injuries.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nDunure Castle has been in private hands since 1704 and by the middle of the century had fallen into

The Pohangina River was a location I had in mind for a while to re-shoot, but struggled with the cloud cover in this area of the country.

James inherited the entire Douglas estates but he was killed at the Battle of Otterburn. The mother of the illegitimate George now sought to promote her son's claim. The Douglas family divided into two factions with James' heir - Archibald the Grim - leading the Black Douglases whilst George headed the Red Douglases. Tantallon Castle was held by the latter.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nGeorge died in 1403 and was followed by his son, William. William was a loyal supporter of James II and was used by the King as a gaoler for key opponents. On Royal orders William incarcerated Alexander MacDonald, Lord of the Isles at Tantallon between 1429 and 1431. He later led the King's army at the Battle of Arkinholm (1455) where he decisively defeated the Black Douglases.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe family also frequently clashed with the Crown. It was besieged by both James IV and James V. The end came for Tantallon Castle in 1650. In September that year an English army under Oliver Cromwell had defeated the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar and had subsequently overrun southern Scotland. A force of 91 men under Alexander Seton established their base at Tantallon Castle. Operating from this secure facility they launched attacks on the English supply lines which followed the coastal route back towards Berwick-upon-Tweed.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nUnsurprisingly the English were not willing to leave this garrison in their rear and General George Monck was tasked with reducing the castle. He commenced an artillery bombardment, smashing a breach and took the castle.

Originally built as a fort by the MacDougalls in the early 14th century, in 1388 the Stewarts became the Lords of Lorn and were granted the land which included the castle. For the next 200 years the castle remained a Stewart stronghold, until it was lost to the Campbell's in a drunken bet.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe Stewarts of Appin regained the Castle in 1689 when they came out with King James VII but after defeat at the battle of Dunkeld the Castle was again forfeited to the Campbells. The Stewarts under Ardsheal refused to hand it over when it was then besieged by the Campbells for several months until Ardsheal was granted an honourable surrender in 1690.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nAt the time of the 1745 Rising, Castle Stalker was held by the Campbells with a Garrison of about 59 Government troops. Although the Stewarts of Appin were solidly behind Prince Charles, and raised a regiment of 300, the Castle was too strong for them to take.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe last Campbell was born in the Castle in 1775 and Campbells continued to reside in it until about 1800 when they built a new house on the mainland.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn about 1840 the roof either fell in or was perhaps removed to avoid roof-tax and the Castle was abandoned.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1908 the Castle was regained from the Campbells by Charles Stewart of Achara who purchased it and carried out some basic preservation work to stem its decay.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1947 his successor, Duncan Stewart, who was Governor of Sarawak, was murdered and the Castle devolved on his widow.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn 1965 Lt. Col. D. R.

These simple, hand-thrown weapons had been invented hundreds of years before, but had not been widely used since the Napoleonic era. Reinvented by the requirements of trench warfare, the first grenades in 1914 were often hand-made, consisting of old cans filled with nails and bits of metal and packed with gunpowder. They often proved as dangerous to their makers as to their intended targets, due to the risk of premature explosion.\n\nBy the end of 1915, all armies were being supplied with hand bombs. Rifle grenadiers fired specifically modified grenades from rifles, while the infantry on both sides carried dozens of different types. The Germans tended to prefer the stick bomb, which could be thrown farther but had a smaller explosive charge. The British and Canadians used egg-shaped hand grenades, which could be thrown about 30 metres (10 metres\u00a0fewer than the German sticks), but carried a larger explosive charge.\n\nBy 1917, all infantry carried grenades. All major assaults required attacking troops to carry extra grenades to capture their objectives and then hold them against enemy counterattack.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComrades:\n@jon.the.collector\n@united_warfronts\n~\n~\nBe sure to follow us for more facts about WWI\n~\n~\n#ww1 #germany #Italy #worldwar #historiansunion #trenches #Britain #USA #greatwar #Canada #Scotland #tank #war #history #battle #worldwar1 #Turkey #Churchill #Roosevelt #planes #death #guns #soldiers #royalairforce #followme #Russia #France #Austria #unitedwarfronts", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f0d2f90c192fb2d88f858a9257bc9b7e/5BF2BED1/t51.2885-15/e35/36930914_666797756999951_56316684926976000_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxMzE5NTY5OTMyNDEyMg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 655, "emoji_caption": "in attempting to fight through enemy trenches or to defend against attack all armies came to rely heavily on grenades these simple hand thrown weapons had been invented hundreds of years before but had not been widely used since the napoleonic era reinvented by the requirements of trench warfare the first grenades in were often hand made consisting of old cans filled with nails and bits of metal and packed with gunpowder they often proved as dangerous to their makers as to their intended targets due to the risk of premature explosion by the end of all armies were being supplied with hand bombs rifle grenadiers fired specifically modified grenades from rifles while the infantry on both sides carried dozens of different types the germans tended to prefer the stick bomb which could be thrown farther but had a smaller explosive charge the british and canadians used egg shaped hand grenades which could be thrown about metres metres fewer than the german sticks but carried a larger explosive charge by all infantry carried grenades all major assaults required attacking troops to carry extra grenades to capture their objectives and then hold them against enemy counterattack comrades jonthecollector unitedwarfronts be sure to follow us for more facts about wwi"}, {"id": "37624128_214215029238503_3888391445354119168_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "express", "caption": "jul nd small towns there is something cozy about little towns everyone says hi knows your name and is generally happy to see you today was spent in a number of these small fishery towns and it felt like home", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["ilovetravel", "travellingtheworld", "wonder", "discover", "smalltowns", "happiness", "sightseeing", "ilovesweden", "havefun", "travel", "traveller", "traveljunkie", "travelling", "passportaddict", "tack", "instatravel", "grow", "wanderer", "wonderlust", "sweden", "goingplaces", "gogogo", "happytravels"], "orig_caption": "Jul 22nd: SMALL TOWNS\nThere is something cozy about little towns, everyone says hi, knows your name and is generally happy to see you.

The Norwegians dominated the north and west coasts of Scotland until the mid-13th century and Thurso, which was centrally located on the route from Norway to the Western isles, was chosen as a key residence to serve the Earls of Orkney and Caithness.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nBy the 17th century vast swathes of Caithness and Sutherland were under the control of the powerful Sinclair family. Around 1660 the 6th Earl of Caithness started work on a new castle. Work was overseen by Donald Ross and became George's primary residence. He was an important magnate in northern Scotland but found himself embroiled in a bitter land dispute with the Campbells of Glenorchy. Attempts to resolve the issue through the courts were followed by a decision by the King in favour of the Campbells. This prompted George Sinclair to mount a guerrilla campaign against his rivals.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThurso castle, along with other Sinclair properties were seized by the Campbells but then attacked and badly damaged by George's men. The dispute was eventually resolved following intervention by James, Duke of York (later James VII and II) and thereafter Thurso was repaired.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was substantially rebuilt in 1872 by Sir Tollemache Sinclair.

Lake Clark was declared a National Park in 1980 as part of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. One of the goals: to protect the waters that flow into Bristol Bay, home to the world\u2019s largest salmon fishery. It would take many lifetimes to hike all of Lake Clark\u2019s glaciers, mountains, volcanoes and tundra; paddle all of the park\u2019s lakes and shoreline; and spot the wide range of wildlife large (bears, lynx, eagles and wolves) and small (collared pika and tundra shrew) that call the area home.

By 1320, the palace had been reduced to ruins through neglect.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe building returned to prominence in 1540, when King James V of Scotland arrived in Kirkwall and garrisoned his troops in Kirkwall Castle and the Bishop's Palace.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nSoon after, Bishop Robert Reid, the founder of Edinburgh University and the last and greatest of Orkney's medieval Bishops, began an extensive programme of restoration and reconstruction.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIn the early 1600s, the Bishop's Palace was incorporated into a refined Renaissance palace commissioned by Earl Patrick Stewart, one of Orkney's most notorious rulers.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nToday the palace is open to the public and is administered by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nImage by @myinstascotland \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n#scottish #lovescotland #scotland #historicscotland #stmagnuscathedral #visitscotland #love_scotland #travelinggram #orkney #thisisscotland #master_shots #brilliantbritain #ig_worldclub #igersscotland #goexplore #castle #discoverglobe #discoverearth #roamtheplanet #history #castlesofscotland #scotlandsbeauty #passionpassport #discoverscotland #greatnorthcollective #orkneyislands #norway #royalty #ruins #folkscenery", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c2396d377217d70aaad05af40ea1be01/5BDA30B2/t51.2885-15/e35/37050649_1058659454282772_693635487432179712_n.jpg?se=8&ig_cache_key=MTgyODQ5Mzg2NjQ4ODIyNzI3OA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 5210, "emoji_caption": "kirkwall is the capital of orkney for centuries it was the capital of the norse held nordreyjar the northern isles but that ended in when christian i of norway failed to pay the dowry promised to his son in law james iii of scotland james called in the debt by assuming sovereignty of orkney and shetland \u25ab kirkwall was graced by three fortified medieval residences two of these were the palace and palace \u25ab the palace was built around the same time as st cathedral in the early th century the builder may well have been bishop william the old d crusader and friend of earl rognvald st nephew and patron of the new cathedral \u25ab following defeat at the battle of largs in king hakon iv of norway died within the walls of the palace by the palace had been reduced to ruins through neglect \u25ab the building returned to prominence in when king james v of scotland arrived in kirkwall and garrisoned his troops in kirkwall castle and the bishops palace \u25ab soon after bishop robert reid the founder of edinburgh university and the last and greatest of orkneys medieval bishops began an extensive programme of restoration and reconstruction \u25ab in the early s the bishops palace was incorporated into a refined renaissance palace commissioned by earl patrick stewart one of orkneys most notorious rulers \u25ab today the palace is open to the public and is administered by historic environment scotland as a scheduled monument \u25ab image by myinstascotland"}, {"id": "36889203_252941208769664_2491814912741867520_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "tchalamet in call me by your name via clo", "contextual": "close", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "@tchalamet in Call Me By Your Name\nVia @c__l__o", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a6d6071b1d8958bd2c82a63718fe88ce/5BD140E7/t51.2885-15/e35/36889203_252941208769664_2491814912741867520_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyODYwMDI0MTI2MTk0NDIwMQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 15725, "emoji_caption": "tchalamet in call me by your name via clo"}, {"id": "37342628_289261011845159_5756995565380435968_n", "semiotic": "divergent", "intent": "expose", "caption": "about last night", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["lacomedy", "entertainment", "laughs", "westsidetheater", "nightlife", "standup", "comedy", "laughter", "santamonica"], "orig_caption": "About last night \u2728\n\n#entertainment #comedy #standup #westsidetheater #santamonica #nightlife #laughs #laughter #lacomedy", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/3ba03c309e4fa9ef82190b9a6f3c0c50/5BD15B4B/t51.2885-15/e35/37342628_289261011845159_5756995565380435968_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTM3MTQ0NTM2MTc0Nzg4Ng%3D%3D.2", "likes": 30, "emoji_caption": "about last night \u2728"}, {"id": "37014828_2110939279225242_2551373812646019072_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "promote", "caption": "does anyone wanna sponsor me in walk for life it will be held september th at crisis pregnancy center in gastonia message me for more details", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["walkforlife", "savebabys", "prolife", "crisispregnancy"], "orig_caption": "Does anyone wanna sponsor me in walk for life?

I don\u2019t know about you guys, but\u2014when I was in school\u2014I was most concerned with my classroom supplies, getting a new backpack, and what I was going to wear for the first week back to class. It\u2019s funny how we spend so much time prepping for our education, but very little time preparing our spirits for what it takes to be a Christian on and off campus. Any place you go becomes and mission field for God when you are an ambassador for Christ. That doesn\u2019t mean shouting scriptures at the top of your lungs when you walk down the hallway, but it does mean building up your faith and preparing yourself to be a witness in the midst of peer pressure, bullying, drama, and gossip. In my latest YouTube video, I talk about four ways to keep your walk with God strong on campus. Whether you\u2019re in middle school, high school, or college (or know someone who is), click on the link in my bio to watch. Share with anyone you think could benefit from this information it as well. Now it\u2019s your turn: what are some of the things that helped you keep your faith strong in school?

For the longest time I used to think the same way, but an aesthetically pleasing body is not a body that looks malnourished/weak(at least for me it isn\u2019t ). The number on the scale became irrelevant to my goals. I came to realize that it is pointless to have shredded abs and vascularity if I wasn\u2019t able to run 10+ miles on any given day, bench press my weight with ease, or get my chin over that bar 20 times. So girls, focus on how fast/far you can run, how heavy you can lift, how many pull-ups/pushups you can do. Performance trumps aesthetics every time. Create a body that\u2019s a furnace \ud83d\udd25, the best part about that is that it doesn\u2019t require constant regulation of your weight, macros, and calories. Create a metabolism that\u2019s so hyped up that you don\u2019t have to worry about how many carne asada tacos you had for lunch or whether you should get dessert or not. Remember that it\u2019s called body BUILDING for a reason. So stuff your pretty face, lift heavy weights, and build the shhhhh** out of that body. \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd\ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n#doyoueveneatbro #eatlikeaking #liftlikeabeast #consistencyiskey #fitpugmom #loveyourbody #eatyourdonuts #performanceiskey #bodybuilder #murves #5weeksout\ud83d\udc59 #allyearround #femalemarine #girlswholift #girlswhoeat #treatyoself #flexfriday", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/a04ac2379607a8817bb52801576371cb/5BCCC381/t51.2885-15/e35/37029420_1849017972072460_7765902110754865152_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyNzk0MTk2OTY3NTEzNzU5Ng%3D%3D.2", "likes": 2912, "emoji_caption": "some women believe that working out for aesthetic purposes requires hours on the treadmill reaching an all time low on the scale and sticking to a regimented bro diet of chicken and rice three times a dayand it for the longest time i used to think the same way but an aesthetically pleasing body is not a body that looks malnourishedweakat least for me it the number on the scale became irrelevant to my goals i came to realize that it is pointless to have shredded abs and vascularity if i able to run miles on any given day bench press my weight with ease or get my chin over that bar times so girls focus on how fastfar you can run how heavy you can lift how many pull upspushups you can do performance trumps aesthetics every time create a body a furnace \ud83d\udd25 the best part about that is that it require constant regulation of your weight macros and calories create a metabolism so hyped up that you have to worry about how many carne asada tacos you had for lunch or whether you should get dessert or not remember that called body building for a reason so stuff your pretty face lift heavy weights and build the shhhhh out of that body \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd \ud83c\udfcb\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udc59"}, {"id": "36526657_273530333399826_1876977781540126720_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "inform", "caption": "nurse showing newspaper headline about polio vaccine to a man on chest respirator due to polio", "contextual": "close", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "Nurse showing newspaper headline about Polio Vaccine, to a man on chest respirator due to polio, 1955", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/b80509336b6f65221179e5aaf764ead6/5BE2DF3E/t51.2885-15/e35/36526657_273530333399826_1876977781540126720_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTgyNDE4MDE0NDk0OTQwMDAwMQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 11499, "emoji_caption": "nurse showing newspaper headline about polio vaccine to a man on chest respirator due to polio"}, {"id": "13628055_1766751676873596_1194562486_n", "semiotic": "additive", "intent": "inform", "caption": "curiosity has begun its months long trek up a mudstone rock outcrop at the base of mount sharp as climbs higher younger geological evidence is available for analysis to learn more about how ancient environmental conditions evolved from available freshwater to conditions less favorable toward life this photo was taken by the right side on sol utc instagram contrast enhanced photo no filter", "contextual": "transcendent", "tags": ["MastCam", "AeolisMons", "Curiosity"], "orig_caption": "Curiosity has begun its months-long trek up a mudstone rock outcrop at the base of Mount Sharp (#AeolisMons).
