A new model finds the oceans actually formed concurrently, or even hundreds of millions of years before, its volcanic system. According to Dr. Michael Manga of UC Berkley, \u201cWe're saying that the oceans predate and accompany the lava outpourings that made Tharsis....Eruptions triggered by the volcanic system also created channels that allowed underground water to reach the surface and fill the northern plains.\" So do you think there were once Martians and do you think they ever surfed? #mars #oceans #science \ud83d\udcf7 M.

It's disgusting to see rich people spend what would be someone's annual salary on purses when some of us can't afford food, housing, and other basic needs. You shouldn't be allowed to have more than one house when there are hundreds of thousands of people living on the streets. The spectacle of wealth on Instagram alone is appalling. I try to ignore it, but this shit comes up in my \"Explore\" all the damn time. I've even blocked some celebrities. Equity is nowhere in this damn country. You as an actor/actress, high paid musician/artist, or athlete do not work harder than plumbers, wait staff, or cleaners. If we want to be truly radical, we would destroy capitalism in favor of communism, y'all. (And before people are all, \"OMG communism \ud83d\ude31! Why not socialism?\" In short, Socialism is an economic system while communism is both an economic and political system. Socialism allows capitalism to exist in its midst while communism seeks to get rid of capitalism, and that's what we truly need). I'm just real tired of the bullshit. I'm tired of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. #destroycapitalism #socialism #communism #eattherich", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/457ba49f25ee210941d33a78cfff2400/5BEF7865/t51.2885-15/e35/32343551_195576251267805_5185893029591908352_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTcwMzA2MzYyMDc3MzMwMDM4Ng%3D%3D.2", "likes": 8118, "emoji_caption": "in this country in this world nobody should be able to be a millionaire or billionaire a millionairebillionaire does not work harder to earn their money than someone working a minimum wage job millionairesbillionaires have more resources which gets them ahead of everyone else thats it its disgusting to see rich people spend what would be someones annual salary on purses when some of us cant afford food housing and other basic needs you shouldnt be allowed to have more than one house when there are hundreds of thousands of people living on the streets the spectacle of wealth on instagram alone is appalling i try to ignore it but this shit comes up in my explore all the damn time ive even blocked some celebrities equity is nowhere in this damn country you as an actoractress high paid musicianartist or athlete do not work harder than plumbers wait staff or cleaners if we want to be truly radical we would destroy capitalism in favor of communism yall and before people are all omg communism \ud83d\ude31 why not socialism in short socialism is an economic system while communism is both an economic and political system socialism allows capitalism to exist in its midst while communism seeks to get rid of capitalism and thats what we truly need im just real tired of the bullshit im tired of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer"}, {"id": "36085890_1821071574598030_1970137000874868736_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "by tonykellyworld for plastikmagazine", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["plastikxtonykelly"], "orig_caption": "\u2018Pool side\u2019 by @tonykellyworld for @plastikmagazine #plastikxtonykelly", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/29ee5d6ea46c81652051c99dc66600bc/5C120838/t51.2885-15/e35/36085890_1821071574598030_1970137000874868736_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgxMzcyMDQzMDI0Mzk4OTk1OA%3D%3D.2", "likes": 847, "emoji_caption": "pool side by tonykellyworld for plastikmagazine"}, {"id": "36876952_174827073232724_8671557494817947648_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "brentonsalo via somewherecollective", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "@brentonsalo\nVia @somewhere.collective", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/9a19dba0abe9ad50039c0afde84591b7/5BD01A5C/t51.2885-15/e35/36876952_174827073232724_8671557494817947648_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyODQ3NDM3Mzk0MDQzMTcwOQ%3D%3D.2", "likes": 25179, "emoji_caption": "brentonsalo via somewherecollective"}, {"id": "36160522_2272288599665503_3734733479896678400_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "express", "caption": "everybody a happy", "contextual": "minimal", "tags": ["sunnyday", "monday", "behappy", "lovenature", "summervibes", "loveflowers", "nofilter"], "orig_caption": "\u2600\ufe0fWish everybody a happy Monday\u2600\ufe0f #lovenature #loveflowers #nofilter #behappy #monday #summervibes #sunnyday", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/32e04832bb4648ee29e8b69a3af7cd3b/5BDC4C05/t51.2885-15/e35/36160522_2272288599665503_3734733479896678400_n.jpg?efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJ1cmxnZW5fZnJvbV9pZyJ9&se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgxOTc0NDE3MDY0Njk5NDEwMw%3D%3D.2", "likes": 0, "emoji_caption": "\u2600 wish everybody a happy monday \u2600"}, {"id": "37276300_184023545795999_7453473571029909504_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "entertain", "caption": "", "contextual": "close", "tags": [], "orig_caption": "\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46\ud83c\udf46", "url": "https://scontent-lga3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/f73b6403ec00452b74b199969bce81a5/5BCBEA11/t51.2885-15/e35/37276300_184023545795999_7453473571029909504_n.jpg?se=7&ig_cache_key=MTgyOTMxMzYxNDQ1NzEyNzAwNg%3D%3D.2", "likes": 20, "emoji_caption": "\ud83c\udf46 \ud83c\udf46 \ud83c\udf46"}, {"id": "37053283_242027459944511_5365913933808926720_n", "semiotic": "parallel", "intent": "express", "caption": "happy birthday alice and rich", "contextual": "close", "tags": ["happybirthday", "cake", "celebration", "nomnom", "chocolate"], "orig_caption": "Happy Birthday Alice and Rich!

I\u2019ve taken a job doing travel Speech Therapy, so that Bean and I can explore the country in a new state and city every 3 months and live a life that is more in tune with ourselves and the planet! This is a back up plan, as I really just wanted to live in a van and travel. But this seems more responsible... for now \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09We sold our 2000 era Honda Accords and traded up for a gently used Toyota RAV4  whom we\u2019ve Named Simon\ud83d\ude99.

We\u2019re excited to explore  as many US national parks and forests as possible in these next few months.... We are definitely sad to leave Columbus\u2014 it\u2019s been our home for 2+ years, and Home to so many wonderful people we are lucky to call our friends.

A seemingly insignificant sin yet still dishonoring. Regardless, sin literally means missing the mark. So often, we miss the mark. This is such a disheartening truth that compels us to find compensation. This \u201ccompensation\u201d also takes on many forms, most of which are other sins ironically enough. But the only remedy for our inability to hit the mark is Jesus Christ. Through his bloodshed, we have forgiveness. This changes everything. This integrates a spirit of redemption. We can take refuge in him (Psalm 46:1). He renews our strength (Isaiah 40:31). He cleanses is from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).

The main feature was a Tower House which was surrounded by a barmkin (curtain wall) enclosing the ancillary buildings such as brewhouse, bakehouse and stables. Sir Henry died in 1420 without leaving a male heir and his estates were subsequently divided between his daughters.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nTolquhon Castle passed through his second daughter, Marjorie, to her husband, Sir John Forbes. It would remain with his family for almost 300 years.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nThe castle was rebuilt by William Forbes between 1584 and 1589. After his death Tolquhon Castle passed to his son, William. Further upgrades to the castle were planned but were never enacted nor were any additional modifications made by any of his successors although the surrounding gardens were re-landscaped in the late seventeenth century.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nIt was during this period that the Forbes rose in prominence under the Stewart monarchs. Alexander Forbes had saved the life of Charles II during the Battle of Worcester (1651) and, after the Restoration of the monarchy, was knighted. The family remained loyal to the Stewarts even after the Glorious Revolution and accordingly the then owner, William Forbes, supported the 1715 Jacobite Rebellion. Parliament declared his estates forfeit in 1716 but he refused to vacate and had to be forcibly evicted in September 1718.\n\u25ab\ufe0f\nTolquhon Castle ceased to be a high status residence at this time and was eventually purchased by the Earl of Aberdeen to use as a farm house.
